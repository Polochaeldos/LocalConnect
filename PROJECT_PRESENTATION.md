[Customer App] ←→ [Next.js Frontend] ←→ [Firebase Backend]
                        ↓                      ↓
[Provider Dashboard] ←→ [React Context] ←→ [Firestore DB]
                        ↓                      ↓
[Admin Panel]      ←→ [Auth System]    ←→ [Google Maps API]
```

  const dayAvailability = provider.availability[dayOfWeek];
  
  // Verify time slot availability
  const conflictingBooking = existingBookings.find(booking => 
    booking.scheduledDate === date && 
    booking.scheduledTime === time &&
    ['pending', 'confirmed'].includes(booking.status)
  );
  
  return !conflictingBooking && withinWorkingHours;
};
```
